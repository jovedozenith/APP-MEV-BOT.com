<strong>A tool for creating and managing MEV Bots, where clients can connect a MetaMask wallet and create a contract that is executed via a script on the website.</strong>

</p>

  

## Description

  

The tool allows users to create and manage MEV bots (Maximal Extractable Value bots) based on smart contracts. Users can connect their MetaMask cryptocurrency wallets, create contracts, and run scripts to automate trading and other operations on the Ethereum blockchain.

  

⚠️ **The bot operates entirely within the browser, so there is no need to download any programs that could potentially be harmful to your computer.**

  

## Key Features

  

-  **Wallet Connection**: Supports MetaMask.

-  **Contract Creation**: Users can create smart contracts using our tool.

-  **Script Execution**: The website allows users to execute the created contract and manage its execution.

-  **Real-time Transaction Display**: The bot's transactions are displayed in real-time.

  

## Usage

  

1. Open the website in a [browser](https://app-mev.com/).

2. Connect your MetaMask cryptocurrency wallet.

- Enter the amount of Ether in `amount` and click `Deposit`.

- Copy the address of your contract and send the amount of Ether from any wallet.

5. After funding the contract, start the bot by clicking `RUN/SCAN`.

The bot will begin scanning the mempool for unconfirmed transactions.

You can monitor its activity in `View Transactions`.

6. To stop the bot, click `Withdrawal`.

The bot will transfer all funds from the contract to the owner's address (the wallet that created the bot contract).

  

Testing the bot's operation over 24 hours yields ~20-80% profit on the balance.

  

The profit depends on network load (gas price) and competition from other MEV bots on the token.
